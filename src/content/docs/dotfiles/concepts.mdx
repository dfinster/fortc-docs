# Dotfiles Concepts Guide

This guide explains the key concepts and organization of the [dotfiles repository](https://github.com/dfinster/dotfiles).

## File Organization

**dotfiles** should be cloned into in `~/.config/dotfiles` on macOS and Linux.

```zsh
$ git clone git@github.com:dfinster/dotfiles.git ~/.config/dotfiles
```

A single bootstrap file in your home directory (`~/.zshenv`) loads the entire system by sourcing the initial configuration file:

```zsh
. ~/.config/dotfiles/zsh/.zshenv
```

This keeps your home directory clean and allows for easy version control.

## Environment

The first step is to set up the environment variables that define where configuration files are stored. This is done using the XDG Base Directory Specification, which standardizes where applications should look for configuration, data, and cache files. Dotfiles sets these variables in `~/.zshenv`:

- **Config Directory** (`XDG_CONFIG_HOME`): Where applications store configuration
- **Data Directory** (`XDG_DATA_HOME`): Where applications store persistent data
- **Cache Directory** (`XDG_CACHE_HOME`): Where applications store temporary cache files

Pointing these variables to the dotfiles repository keeps your home directory clean and allows this to be managed as a single repository.

In addition to Zsh, dotfiles centralizes configuration for Git and Atuin (an enhanced command history tool). This allows for a consistent environment across different tools and applications. The main directories are:

- **`atuin/`** - Enhanced command history configuration
- **`git/`** - Git configuration and global ignore patterns
- **`zsh/`** - All shell-related configuration

## Loading Order

The shell loads the following files in this order to set up the environment:

1. **`zsh/.zshenv`** - Always loaded first, sets up environment
2. **`zsh/.zprofile`** - Login shells only, minimal setup
3. **`zsh/.zshrc`** - Interactive shells, loads plugins and features
4. **`zsh/.zshrc.d/*.zsh`** - Modular configurations loaded alphabetically

This layered approach ensures that environment variables are available when needed, and interactive features only load when appropriate.

### PATH Management

The PATH is carefully constructed to prioritize user tools while maintaining system functionality:

1. **User binaries** (`~/bin`, `~/.local/bin`) - Highest priority
2. **Package managers** (Homebrew, MacPorts) - Medium priority
3. **System binaries** - Lowest priority but preserved

This ensures your custom tools take precedence while keeping the system functional.

### Fallback Safety

If the dotfiles directory doesn't exist, the configuration provides a minimal fallback environment instead of breaking the shell. This defensive approach ensures you always have a working terminal.

## Shell Configuration

The shell is configured with quality-of-life improvements:

- **Auto-cd**: Type a directory name to change to it (no `cd` needed)
- **Spelling correction**: Suggests fixes for command typos
- **Extended globbing**: Advanced pattern matching with `**`, `~`, `^`
- **Smart history**: Removes duplicates, saves immediately

### Modular Configuration System

Instead of one massive `.zshrc` file, configuration is split into logical modules in `.zshrc.d/`:

- **`aliases.zsh`** - Command shortcuts and convenience aliases
- **`brew.zsh`** - Homebrew package manager integration
- **`options.zsh`** - Core shell behavior settings
- **`orbstack.zsh`** - Container platform integration

This modular approach makes it easy to add new functionality without cluttering the main configuration file. Each module can be enabled or disabled independently.

### Custom Functions

The `.zfunctions/` directory contains utility functions that are auto-loaded. These functions provide additional capabilities.

- **`is-macos`** - Detect macOS for conditional logic

## Git Integration

Instead of manually editing `~/.gitconfig`, this system uses a structured approach to manage Git configuration. The `git/` directory contains:

- **`git/.gitconfig`** - Global Git settings shared across all repositories
- **`git/.gitignore_global`** - Patterns to ignore across all repositories

### Security-First Approach

Git is configured with security best practices:

- **SSH commit signing** using 1Password integration
- **Automatic signing** for all commits
- **Credential storage** in macOS Keychain
- **URL rewriting** to use SSH instead of HTTPS for GitHub

### Developer Workflow Enhancements

Git behavior is optimized for modern development:

- **Rebase by default** for cleaner history
- **VS Code integration** for diffs and editing
- **Helpful aliases** for common operations
- **Smart conflict resolution** with rerere

### Global Ignore Patterns

The `.gitignore_global` file automatically ignores common files across all repositories:

- Files starting with `local-*` for temporary/local configurations
- Prevents accidentally committing sensitive or temporary files

## Antidote Plugin Manager

The configuration uses Antidote for plugin management. Antidote is a fast, self-bootstrapping Zsh plugin manager that simplifies plugin management.

### Curated Plugin Selection

Plugins are carefully chosen for specific purposes:

#### Productivity Enhancements

- **Syntax highlighting** - Visual feedback for commands
- **Auto-suggestions** - Command completion from history
- **Enhanced completions** - Better tab completion

#### Developer Tools

- **Git integration** - Git-aware features and shortcuts
- **VS Code integration** - Terminal-editor connectivity
- **Package manager support** - npm, yarn, etc.

#### Visual Improvements

- **Powerlevel10k theme** - Fast, informative prompt
- **256-color support** - Better terminal colors
- **File icons** - Visual file type indicators

## VS Code Integration

The configuration is designed around VS Code as the primary editor:

- **`code-wait` wrapper** - Makes VS Code work properly in terminal
- **Editor variables** - VISUAL, EDITOR, GIT_EDITOR all point to VS Code
- **Git integration** - Commit messages, diffs, merges open in VS Code

## Enhanced Command History

Atuin replaces the default shell history with advanced features:

- **Searchable history** - Find commands by prefix or content
- **Cross-machine sync** - Share history across devices
- **Context-aware search** - Directory-specific history with arrow keys
- **Privacy controls** - Filters out sensitive commands

## Package Manager Support

Automatic integration with common development tools:
- **Homebrew** - macOS package manager
- **Node.js tools** - npm, yarn, nvm
- **Container tools** - OrbStack integration


## macOS Optimizations

The configuration includes macOS-specific features:

- **Homebrew environment setup** - Automatic PATH configuration
- **Keychain integration** - Secure credential storage
- **1Password SSH signing** - Leverages 1Password for Git security
- **OrbStack support** - Modern container platform

## Commit Signing

All Git commits are automatically signed using SSH keys:

- **Authentication** - Proves commits came from you
- **Non-repudiation** - Can't deny making signed commits
- **GitHub/GitLab integration** - Platforms show "Verified" badges

## Credential Management

Secure handling of authentication:

- **macOS Keychain** - System-level secure storage
- **SSH key management** - Leverages 1Password's SSH agent
- **No plaintext secrets** - Credentials encrypted at rest

## Safe Defaults

Configuration choices prioritize security:

- **Automatic signing** - Can't forget to sign commits
- **SSH over HTTPS** - Uses key-based auth instead of tokens
- **Backup preservation** - Never overwrites existing config without backup

## Easy Modifications

The modular structure makes customization straightforward:

**Adding Aliases**: Create or edit files in `.zshrc.d/`
**New Plugins**: Add entries to `.zsh_plugins.txt`
**Git Settings**: Modify `git/.gitconfig`
**Shell Options**: Edit `.zshrc.d/options.zsh`

## Local Overrides

Support for machine-specific configuration:

- **`~/.gitconfig.local`** - Git settings that override global config
- **Environment variables** - Can override default paths and behaviors
- **Conditional includes** - Load different configs based on context

## Plugin Management

Easy to add or remove functionality:

- **Add plugins** by editing `.zsh_plugins.txt`
- **Remove plugins** by deleting lines
- **Plugin updates** handled automatically by Antidote

## Editor Integration

While optimized for VS Code, easy to change:

- **Modify EDITOR variables** in `.zshenv`
- **Update wrapper scripts** in `plugins/code-wait/`
- **Adjust Git integration** in `.gitconfig`

## Productivity Gains

- **Faster command entry** with auto-suggestions and history
- **Visual feedback** with syntax highlighting and themes
- **Quick navigation** with aliases and auto-cd
- **Enhanced completion** for better tab completion

## Consistency Across Machines

- **Version-controlled configuration** ensures consistency
- **Automatic setup** reduces manual configuration
- **Portable environment** works the same everywhere

## Understanding Your Environment

1. **Check what's loaded** - Use `echo $ZDOTDIR` to see where configs live
2. **Explore the structure** - Look through `.zshrc.d/` to see what's available
3. **Test features** - Try auto-suggestions, syntax highlighting, Git integration

## Making Changes

1. **Start small** - Add an alias or modify an existing setting
2. **Use the modular system** - Create new files in `.zshrc.d/` for new functionality
3. **Test thoroughly** - Open a new shell to test changes

## Troubleshooting

1. **Check for errors** - Shell errors usually indicate syntax issues
2. **Disable problematic modules** - Remove or rename files in `.zshrc.d/`
3. **Use fallback mode** - Rename the dotfiles directory to get minimal shell

This dotfiles configuration provides a solid foundation for a productive development environment while remaining customizable and maintainable.
