A collection of personal dotfiles and configuration files for Zsh, Git, and Atuin.

- See the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/dfinster/dotfiles).
- See the [Installation guide](/dotfiles/installation) for setup instructions.
- See the [Concepts guide](/dotfiles/concepts) to learn about the overall structure and features.

This is inspired by [`getantidote/zdotdir`](https://github.com/getantidote/zdotdir) and extended to manage as many dotfiles as possible.
