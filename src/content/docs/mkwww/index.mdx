description: An SSG implemented in bash
---
A minimal static Markdown-to-HTML blog generator, written in bash, with a Python hot-reloading dev server. It's the dumbest thing that could possibly work.

import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Aside type="tip">

See the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/dfinster/mkwww).

</Aside>

- Converts Markdown in `/posts` to static HTML in `/output`
- Designed to deploy at Cloudflare
- Frontmatter is in YAML.

| Key           | Description                       | Required? |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------| ----------|
| `title`       | Page title                        | Yes       |
| `description` | The OpenGraph description         | Yes       |
| `date`        | Publication date                  | No        |
| `subtitle`    | Page subtitle                     | No        |
| `unlisted`    | `true` suppress the index listing | No        |

Posts are listed in `index.html`, newest first. Undated posts appear last.

## Prerequisites

To run `mkwww.sh`:

- Set `config.sh` to your values
- Install [Pandoc](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc)
- Have a `bash` shell with `awk`, `sed`, and other other typical GNU tools
- When deploying at Cloudflare, set `"$CF_PAGES" = "true"` in the Cloudflare build configuration. This triggers the script to install Pandoc in the build container, and skip the debouncing logic used by the hot reload server.
- Run `mkwww.sh` in the root of the repo. It will create an `output` directory with the generated HTML files.
- Install a python virtual environment with `pip install -r requirements.txt` to run the hot reload server. This is optional, but recommended for local development. Or, use `direnv` to create a virtual environment automatically based on the `.envrc` file.
- Run the hot reloading dev server with `./dev-server.py`. This will watch for changes in the `posts` directory and automatically rebuild the HTML files when changes are detected.

## Usage

Run the script in the repo's root:

```bash
$ ./mkwww.sh
```

View local output in a browser: `./output/index.html`
