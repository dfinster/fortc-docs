Do you have a lot of local branches that have been deleted on the remote server, but still linger in your local repository? This script helps you clean up those branches safely.

### What the script does — step-by-step

| Step | Command                          | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                                                                                                                                           |
|------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | `set -euo pipefail`              | Exit on the first error (`-e`), treat unset variables as errors (`-u`), and make pipelines fail if any element fails (`pipefail`).                                                                                                 |                                                                                                                                                           |
| 2    | `git fetch --prune`              | Updates all remotes _and_ removes any **remote-tracking** branches that have been deleted on the server (e.g., `origin/feature-x`).                                                                                                |                                                                                                                                                           |
| 3    | \`git branch -vv …               | grep 'gone]'\`                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Builds the array `gone_branches`: local branches whose _upstream_ (remote-tracking) reference was just pruned and now shows “_gone_” in `git branch -vv`. |
| 4    | If none found                    | Prints _“No branches with gone upstream found.”_ and exits.                                                                                                                                                                        |                                                                                                                                                           |
| 5    | Print the list                   | Echoes the branch names so you can see what’s about to happen.                                                                                                                                                                     |                                                                                                                                                           |
| 6    | `git branch --merged` vs. list   | Splits the “gone” branches into:  _merged\_branches_ — already fully merged into **HEAD** (typically `main`) and therefore safe for `git branch -d`;  _unmerged\_branches_ — contain commits that are **not** reachable from HEAD. |                                                                                                                                                           |
| 7    | Prompt to delete merged branches | For each merged branch it runs `git branch -d` **interactively** (`xargs -0 -n1 -p …`). You have to press `y` (or `n`) for every deletion.                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                           |
| 8    | Report unmerged branches         | Merely prints them and warns they would need `git branch -D` (force delete) but does **not** delete them.                                                                                                                          |                                                                                                                                                           |

### Is it “safe”?

![Is it safe?](../../../assets/marathon-man.jpeg)

- **Nothing happens unless you answer “y”** at the first prompt, and then you still get a _second_ prompt for every branch because of `xargs -p`.
- It never touches the remote server — only local branch references.
- It uses `git branch -d`, which _refuses_ to delete a branch that is not fully merged into the current HEAD.
  In other words, even if the script’s “merged” test were wrong, Git itself will still protect you.

So, operationally, it is about as safe as such a cleanup script can be.

### Possible negative outcomes / caveats

| Risk                                         | How it could happen                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Mitigation / recovery                                                                                                                 |
|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Accidental loss of a useful local branch** | You approve deletion, then realise later you still needed it (e.g., for an in-progress rebase).                                                                                                                        | The branch tip is still in `git reflog` for 90 days by default; you can `git reflog`, find the commit, and `git branch <name> <SHA>`. |
| **False “merged” classification**            | Very rare, but could occur if you’re on a branch other than the usual integration branch (`main`) when you run the script, because `git branch --merged` compares against _current HEAD_.                              | Run the script from your primary integration branch, or change `git branch --merged` to `--merged main`.                              |
| **Remote renamed / forked**                  | If a teammate renamed the remote branch and pushed it elsewhere, your local branch now shows “gone” even though work continues under a new name. Deleting it means you lose the convenient reflog link to its history. | Double-check the printed list before confirming; if in doubt, answer **N** and investigate.                                           |
| **Edge-case branch names**                   | Branch names containing newlines or unusual bytes could confuse text processing (though the script is largely null-delimited).                                                                                         | Unlikely in normal workflows; Git itself discourages such names.                                                                      |
| Script aborts mid-way                        | Because of `set -euo pipefail`, any unexpected error (e.g., network hiccup during `git fetch`) terminates the script. Nothing is partially deleted.                                                                    | Just re-run after fixing the root cause.                                                                                              |

### Bottom line

_The script is a convenience wrapper around standard Git commands for pruning local branches whose upstreams have disappeared._
If you review the printed branch list and confirm only what you truly want to delete — ideally while checked out on `main` or `develop` — the worst-case consequence is deleting a branch you later decide you want, which is recoverable via `git reflog` or by fetching it again if it still exists on a remote.
