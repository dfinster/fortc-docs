description: A few things I'm working on

These are a few projects I'm working on, both for fun, and to learn some new things. You can find more about me on my [personal blog](https://fortc.com).

- [Dotfiles](/dotfiles/): My dotfiles project, which I use to configure my development environment across different machines.
- [mkwww](/mkwww/): The dumbest possible static site generator. I built this as a practical joke. It turned out to be a fun little project that I used to generate my personal website for a few weeks before I lost interest in it.
- [clean-branches](/clean-branches/): A tool to clean up branches in a Git repository. It helps you keep your local repository tidy by removing branches that have been merged or are no longer needed. (I have a much better version of this in the works, but it's not ready yet.)
